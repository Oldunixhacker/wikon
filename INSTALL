Wikon 1.0 "Aggresive Animal" Install Guide
==========================================
This file explains how to install Wikon for your wiki. This process
is fairly simple and straightforward.

You should be logged in as root while following this tutorial.

Requirements
------------
You will need:
* An operating system other than Windows or similar systems
* Git
* PHP
* Apache, lighttpd, or nginx
* MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite. Support for more databases will be added
  with additional major updates. This guide is for Wikon 1.0.
  You will also need php-mysqli (php-mysql on some Linux distros),
  php-pgsql, or php-sqlite3 respectively.

Soft Requirements
-----------------
* To use the CaptchaEditing extension, install and enable the GD library.
* [for MySQL users only] For security reasons, you should disable
  .mysql_history by linking it to /dev/null. The file will contain your
  database password which could be used to perform admin-only actions
  with immoral hacking. You can do this with this command:

       rm ~/.mysql_history
       ln -s /dev/null ~/.mysql_history

Getting Wikon
-------------
Choose a path that your server software is set up to serve files at.

To install Wikon, run this command in the directory where you would
like to install it:

    git clone https://github.com/TylerMS887/wikon w --branch rel-full/aggressive --depth 1

This will download the entire Wikon 1.0 package. If you want to only
download the wiki and not bundled extensions, run this instead:

    git clone https://github.com/TylerMS887/wikon w --branch rel-core/aggressive --depth 1

Database Setup
--------------
Before your wiki can work, you will need to set up the database.

MySQL Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~
MySQL is the recommended choice for Wikon wikis.

If you don't have access to the shell (most hosting providers disallow shell
access for safety reasons), you may be able to use a MySQL management
tool provided by your hosting service, such as phpMyAdmin or Adminer.

Open the MySQL console and run the following commands:

    CREATE DATABASE wiki;
    CREATE USER 'wikiuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    GRANT ALL ON wiki.* TO 'wikiuser'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

Replace "wiki" with the name of the database you would like to use, "wikiuser"
with the MySQL username you would like to use, and most importantly,
"password" with a password to use for your user.

Do not leave the password as "password" as this is insecure and can be
thought to be leaked in this file.

SQLite Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~
SQLite works pretty well with Wikon.

If you don't have access to the shell (most hosting providers disallow shell
access for safety reasons), you may be able to use an SQLite management
tool provided by your hosting service, such as phpLiteAdmin.

Run the following command in the directory where you want to store the
database:

    sqlite3 wikon.sqlite3

This will create an empty SQLite database.
This path will be configured as the Wikon database in setup.

PostgreSQL Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
PostgreSQL is not officially tested but should work.

If you don't have access to the shell (most hosting providers disallow shell
access for safety reasons), you may be able to use a PostgreSQL management
tool provided by your hosting service, such as phpPgAdmin.

Open the PostgreSQL console and run the following commands:

    CREATE USER wikiuser WITH NOCREATEDB NOCREATEROLE NOSUPERUSER ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'password';
    CREATE DATABASE wiki WITH OWNER wikiuser;

Replace "wiki" with the name of the database you would like to use, "wikiuser"
with the PostgreSQL username you would like to use, and most importantly,
"password" with a password to use for your user.

Do not leave the password as "password" as this is insecure and can be
thought to be leaked in this file.
